#feature #1: APM with ISTIO
#feature #2: Auto-Configure IDE Debugger on "kubify debug"  
#more features that come to mind:
- auto configure vscode eclipse and pycharm move versions to one file
- ensure virtual env everywhere
- brew to use virtualenv
- python to use virtualenv (with full automation and coverage)
- serial number filtering 
- waf
- istio with APM by default!!
- service mesh
- UI
- Multi-Cloud (Checkmark and BAM you are backed by another cloud)
	- MCDS (coined fun phrase by Kubify OS): Multi-Cloud Distributed Services !!!! Super Awesomeness !!!!!! Should be as easy as a checkmark (bool) to enable multiple cloud providers and Kubify would automatically know what to do (focus on your code, you amazing coder, because we love you)..
- DR by default 
- convertor from ecs, heroku, ..
- Versioning to one file paramerized everywhere else. 
- Code listening on remote cluster
